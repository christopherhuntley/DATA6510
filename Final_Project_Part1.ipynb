    "- Create and share a Colab notebook called `FP_Part1.ipynb`\n",
    "- Use Google Sharing to share your notebooks with your teammates. Note that while the documents (files) are shared and jointly editable, the Colab runtime is not. You will figure out what this means and figure out how to work around it.\n",
    "- The notebook should be comprehensive and runnable from top to bottom. \n",
    "- Take care with the [Markdown formatting](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Dropping big, stupidly-formatted blobs of text is very bad form. It's also extremely unprofessional (and will affect your course grade). (Hint: designate one team member as the Markdown maven who makes sure the notebook is organized and easy to read. Treat it like a finished product.) \n",
