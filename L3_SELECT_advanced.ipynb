        "Language takes on a new meaning when you are learning a second one. Suddenly you become a literalist, paying attention to things like grammar and spelling in way you never would in your native language. You find yourself needing people to speak very, very slowly so you can transliterate what you hearing in real time. Then, slowly, you start to get a more intuitive feel for things. Over time you can go a little faster, filling in the gaps when the grammar and spelling aren't exactly perfect. Eventually, if you stick with it, you can even start to think in the language almost as well as a native speaker. Then, if you are *really* diligent, you start to speak totally unconsciously, sometimes forgetting what language you are speaking. (One way to tell someone is a natively bilingual speaker is when they are in a mixed crowd. If they get their languages crossed, so that they speak exactly the wrong language to each person, then you know the person is natively bilingual. They think in both languages at once.)\n",
        "\n",
        "So it is with data. We learn about data by working with datasets, learning conventions like data structures and data types, without really thinking about it much. Data is data, or so we think. Then we come across *foreign* data that doesn't obey all the rules we have been taking for granted. It is then that we *really* start to understand how data works.\n",
        "\n",
        "None of this was new to the people who developed SQL. The language has been around so long and had to be warped to fit so many use cases that there really isn't much it can't handle *with planning and effort*.  \n",

        "In this lesson we will consider some of the many ways to combine data from multiple tables in SQL. Sometimes the integration is pretty straightforward. Sometimes it will take some work and perhaps a few carefully crafted subqueries. And, of course, sometimes it just doesn't work and trying to make it work is just futile and potentially risky. Hopefully, by the end of this lesson you will be able to recognize each case and know what to do.  "

The novice always starts typing long queries from the top, working through the clauses one at a time until they reach the bottom. Then they run the query and 99% of the time it fails. SQL will give some sort of cryptic error message $-$ nobody knows what they mean half the time $-$ and then the novice spends 45 minutes or so staring at the code trying to spot the error.\n",

        "- Where do you start to fix the error? Sometimes a bug is spread over several lines; each line is \"correct\" but the combination of lines with each other is fatally wrong.\n",
        "- Sometimes you don't get an error message at all. Instead, the query just runs forever, until it bricks the server (and your professor gives you an F for destroying everybody's homework). Or, the query just returns nothing, a result set with zero rows.\n",

Your humble professor has gone entire semesters without having a live SQL bug in a class demo. It can be done!

BigQuery is an enterprise data warehouse that solves this problem by enabling super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. Simply move your data into BigQuery and let us handle the hard work. You can control access to both the project and your data based on your business needs, such as giving others the ability to view or query your data.\n",
