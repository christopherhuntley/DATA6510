        "So many analysts get their first taste of data analysis working with spreadsheets. In the first sitting they'll type in some data into a couple of columns, then maybe add some formatting and perhaps column totals. Then they learn about copying cells with calculations in them, the proper use of `$` to freeze the row or column addresses, etc. Eventually, they'll perhaps learn about defining cell ranges as \"databases\" that can be dragged into PivotTables. It all seems so easy! Why not just stick with that? \n",

        "- **While spreadsheets do allow named ranges almost nobody actually uses them.** So, you have to know which rows and columns make up a given range (say `$B2:$F$1093`).

Each record had some (possibly variable) number of **fields**, each representing one datum.

A modern example is the so-called CSV file, where CSV stands for *comma -separated values*.\n",

        "### **Foreign Keys**\n",
