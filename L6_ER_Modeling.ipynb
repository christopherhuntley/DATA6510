        "**Data modeling is something we do *before* we have data.** It's the design activity that makes it possible to collect data for a given purpose. So, data modeling is about what we will do with the data and what we can expect to find as we collect it. The data itself ends up being a collection of artifacts that gets us from data collection to data usage. \n",
        "\n",
        "So, whenever we start design of a new database (i.e., the receptacle for our data) the most important questions are:\n",
        "- What exists now?\n",
        "- What is the data about?\n",
        "- What is the data going to be used for?\n",
        "- How long does the data need to be kept?\n",
        "- Who is going to use the data? \n",
        "\n",
        "Only after we get answers to these questions can we begin to think about the tables, columns, keys, constraints, etc. For example, let's consider the \"What exists now?\" question. What exists now may include any or all of the following: \n",
        "- a paper process used to collect dead tree data and produce reports\n",
        "- people whose jobs are to work with the current data sources every day, perhaps with an organizational hierarchy that determines data access permissions\n",
        "- online systems that need data in a specific format or produce data in a (not necessarily the same) format\n",
        "- end users that don't currently know they need the data \n",
        "- a laundry list of complaints about the current system (or lack of one)\n",
        "- ...\n",
        "It goes on and on. \n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of data modeling is to capture enough detail about the data requirements as possible before we make any technology decisions we might regret later. If, for example, we find that some data needs to be separate from other data because of different sources or user access permissions, then we need to take that into account when designing our tables. Similarly, if some data is permanent and other data is only useful for a couple of weeks, then perhaps we will want to keep them separate as well. \n",

        "\n",
        "In principle, any particular thing could be considered an entity or an attribute. Often it's hard to tell which, at least at first, before we know the context for our database stories. \n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between an entity and an attribute is that entities always have a unique identity within the **domain model** (i.e., context). Recall that in Lesson 4 we defined the relational model using set mappings from **domains** to **codomains**: \n",

        "\n",
        "The items in the domain set are the entities represented by a table. The mappings to the codomains are the attributes. While entities are by definition unique, we could map any given **domain entity** to **attribute values** in any number of codomains. Like the entities, the attribute values themselves are unique but the **attribute mappings** have no such constraint. We could map several entities to the same attribute value or even map an entity to itself (i.e., where codomain = domain) several times if we like. It is in this sense that **entities are unique** while **attribute mappings** are not.\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine if a given item is an entity, we look for **identifier attributes** that make sense in the story context. For example, does a bank need to track individual dollar bills (via serial numbers) or just the number of dollars in a person's account? If the former then dollars are entities. Otherwise, in the absence of a useful identifier, dollar amounts are just values used to describe something else (a customer's account, a financial transaction, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Tip:** Identifier attributes should be immutable, never changing once they have been set. If one is ever tempted to modify an identifier then it is not really an identifier. So, for example, while we informally use people's names as identifiers, names can change and thus make poor identifiers. We are better off defining a new attribute (an id number, for example) and letting the name be just another non-key attribute. \n",
        "\n",
        "Besides the need for unique identifiers, there is another sense in which entities must be unique. **Each entity is always one thing and only one thing.** If an entity is composed of multiple things, then it is actually an **associative entity** that connects other things together. Each of these connected things is an entity, as is the association itself. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider, for example, a marriage between two people. Is that one thing (a marriage) or three things (marriage plus two spouses)? In early versions of the database story it may be just a marriage license with a date, few signatures, and an id number. However, as the story gets fleshed out, one may find the need to represent the people getting married. While it is tempting to just add the details about these people to the marriage license itself, this makes the idea of a marriage license much more complex than it has to be. It also complicates questions like \"Has Toby been married before?\" or \"Is Toby *currently married* to somebody else?\" Instead of looking up Toby (and finding licenses), we would have to scan through licenses to find any with Toby's name. A much better, more savvy, way to do it is to **register each person** separately and then **reference** them on the marriage license. As long as the licenses are **indexed** by person $-$ easily done if each person has a unique identifier $-$ we could find any of Toby's previous marriages on file with one lookup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have the entities worked out, the attributes are usually pretty easy to suss out. All we need to know in an ERD is what they are named, and whether any of them are identifiers (primary keys) or references (foreign keys). Data types and other constraints (e.g., allowed combinations of attribute values) can wait until logical design (in SQL). \n",

        "\n",
        "Scenario B represents a person-centric case, where all that matters is who is currently married to whom. (It's a rare unary mapping of an entity domain onto itself.) Notice the phrasing of the text on the relationship. It describes the action (or more like a condition, depending on your views of marriage) of being married to another person. It is assumed that if person X is married to person Y that the relationship would be noted on both entities. If a person is unmarried, then the `spouseID` would be left blank.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario C separates out the marriage license from the people getting married. In this case we can add more attributes to the `Marriage License` and `Person` entities to indicate things like birthdates, divorce dates, etc. Generally, this is likely how your state records marriages. It is up to them to enforce the \"can't have more than one marriage at a time\" law. \n",
        "\n",
        "> Note that Scenario C allows for marriage to be between more than 2 people. Why? Because standard ERD graphic language doesn't distinguish between \"more than 1\" and \"many\".
